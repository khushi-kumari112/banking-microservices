## Overall Learning 

During my Java internship at SURETrust, I strengthened my core understanding of Java programming and object-oriented concepts. I gained hands-on experience in building logical solutions, working with core Java features, and writing clean, maintainable code. The internship also enhanced my problem-solving abilities, debugging skills, and understanding of real-world application development, along with improving my documentation, collaboration, and professional coding practices.

</div>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Banking Microservices – Capstone Project</h3>
<p>
  Designed and implemented a Banking Application using Microservices architecture with Spring Boot. The system includes services such as account management, transactions, and customer operations. This capstone project strengthened my understanding of scalable system design, inter-service communication, and enterprise-level backend development.

## **Learnings from LST and SST**

<!-- add your experiences over here -->
The LST (Life Skills Training) and SST sessions provided structured guidance on essential personal, professional, and workplace skills. Through LST sessions, I learned professional communication, the value of gratitude, strong work ethics, emotional intelligence, and active listening. These sessions helped me understand workplace behavior, digital presence and etiquette, negotiation skills, leadership, influence, and effective presentation techniques. They also guided me in career growth, goal setting, and building a professional mindset.

The SST sessions focused on developing technical productivity skills using AI. I gained a clear understanding of prompt engineering fundamentals, learned how to write effective prompts for workplace productivity, and explored creative problem-solving using AI tools. The sessions also emphasized the critical evaluation of AI outputs and practical ways to integrate AI into daily workflows responsibly.

Overall, LST and SST sessions significantly improved my communication abilities, confidence, decision-making skills, and readiness to adapt to modern, AI-driven professional environments.
